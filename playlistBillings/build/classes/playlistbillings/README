# Project 2: PlayList

* Author: Parker Billings
* Class: AP CS
* Semester: Spring 2017

## Overview

This program is a playlist maker. It allows a user to type a playlist
into it and it finds the song path. The playlist maker then finds the
songs and orders them to play least length to greatest length.
It also finds the song closest to 4 minutes and the average 
play time.

## Compiling and Using

Compile the program using the command prompt and using javac
PlayList.java and compile Song.java the same way. Type in a song name,
the song author, the song length, and the song file path for 3 songs
continue to run the songs.

## Discussion

I had an easy time with this project.
* The first snag I ran into was trying to get the song
that was closest in legnth to 4 minutes
* The second and only major problem I had was sorting the
songs from least to greatest, but that was resolved using
the Arrays.sort method in the lambda expression

## Testing

I tested the project many times throughout to make sure it ran
in a timely and correct manner as it pertains to running the 
project. The project fully works and has been tested with many songs.

## Extra Credit

I utilized an array and a loop to write to the array for extra credit

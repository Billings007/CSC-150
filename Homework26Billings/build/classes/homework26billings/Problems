5 -16 9 21
22 19 -101 36
18 17 64 -2
1. Write a single line of code that will create the above integer array. Call the array a.
int a[] = { {5,-16,9,21}, {22,19,-101,36},{18,17,64,-2}
2. Write a line of code that will printout the array element occupied by -101
System.out.println(a[2][3]);
3. The above table can be described as
(a) an Array (b) a Matrix
(c) numbers that could represented as subscripted variables
(d) a, b, and c (e) none of these
D
4. Write a line of code that will print the number of rows in matrix a

5. Write a line of code that will print number of columns (in matrix a) in the row given by
index 2.
6. What is printed by System.out.println(a[1][3]); ?
7. What will the following output:
for(int row = 0; row < a.length; row++)
{
 for(int col = 0; col < a[row].length; col++)
 {
 System.out.println(a[row][col] + “\t”);
 }
 System.out.println(“”);
}
8. What is printed by the following:
Arrays.sort(a[0]);
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(a[0], 5));
9. What is printed by the following:
Arrays.sort(a[0]);
System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(a[0], 0));
10. Show what the matrix a would look like after following code executes:
for(int row = 0; row < a.length; row++) 
Homework 26: Two-Dimensional Arrays
{
 for(int col = 0; col < a[row].length; col++)
 a[row][col] = row * col;
}
11. Show what the matrix a would look like after the following code executes:
Arrays.fill(a[2], -156);
12. Must all two-dimensional arrays have the same number of columns in each row?
In the remaining problems, some of the code might not compile or will give a run-time exception.
If that is the case then state, “Won’t compile” or “Run-time exception”.
13. What is printed by the following?
double d[ ][ ] = new double[8][25];
System.out.println(d[4][2]);
14. If x and y both represent two-dimensional int arrays and have identically the same
elements, what does the following print?
System.out.println( Arrays.equals(x, y));
15. Is it possible to sort z (a two-dimensional array) with Arrays.sort(z);?
16. Is it possible to use on of the sort methods of the Arrays class to sort a single row (index
3) of the two-dimensional matrix g? If so, show the code that will accomplish this.
